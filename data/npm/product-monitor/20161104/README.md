## Overview
[`product-monitor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/product-monitor) is an HTML/JavaScript template for monitoring a product by encouraging product developers to gather all the information about the status of a product, including live monitoring, statistics, endpoints, and test results into one place.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.

## Remediation
Upgrade to version `2.2.5` or later.
