				"description": "## Overview\n[`cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli) is an npm package used for rapidly building command line apps. \n\nWhen used in `daemon` mode, the library makes insecure use of two files in the `/tmp/` folder: `/tmp/<app-name>.pid` and `/tmp/<app-name>.log`. These allow an attacker to overwrite files they typically cannot access, but that are accessible by the user running the CLI-using app. This is possible since the `/tmp/` folder is (typically) writeable to all system users, and because the names of the files in question are easily predicted by an attacker.\n\nNote that while this is a real vulnerability, it relies on functionality (`daemon` mode) which is only supported in very old Node versions (0.8 or older), and so is unlikely to be used by most `cli` users. To avoid any doubt, the fixed version (1.0.0) removes support for this feature entirely. \n\n## Details\nFor example, assume user _victim_ occasionally runs a CLI tool called `cli-tool`, which uses the `cli` package.\nIf an attacker gains write access to the `/tmp/` folder of that machine (but not the higher permissions _victim_ has), they can create the symbolic link `/tmp/cli-tool.pid -> /home/victim/important-file`. When _victim_ runs `cli-tool`, the `important-file` in victim's root directory will be nullified. If the CLI tool is run as root, the same can be done to nullify `/etc/passwd` and make the system unbootable. \n\nNote that popular CLI tools have no reason to mask their names, and so attackers can easily guess a long list of tools victims may run by checking the `cli` package [dependents](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/cli).\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `cli` to version `1.0.0` or greater, which disables the affected feature.\n\nFrom the fix release notes:\n```\nThis feature relies on a beta release (e.g. version 0.5.1) of a Node.js\nmodule on npm--one that was superseded by a stable (e.g. version 1.0)\nrelease published three years ago [2]. Due to a build-time dependency on\nthe long-since deprecated `node-waf` tool, the module at that version\ncan only be built for Node.js versions 0.8 and below.\n\nGiven this, actual usage of this feature is likely very limited. Remove\nit completely so the integrity of this module's core functionality can\nbe verified.\n```\n\n## References\n[1] https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=809252\n[2] https://github.com/node-js-libs/cli/commit/fd6bc4d2a901aabe0bb6067fbcc14a4fe3faa8b9\n",

This allows attackers to send malicious requests while inheriting the identity and privileges of the currently logged in user.\n\n## Details\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

Second, the ecstatic server does not handle the exception, triggering the crash.\n\nUpgrading `Ecstatic` will address the second issue and thus fix the vulnerability.\n\n## References\n- Ecstatic fix: https://github.com/jfhbrook/node-ecstatic/pull/179\n- V8 bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=4640\n\n",

The maintainers of JS-YAML have patched this vulnerability and, beginning in version 2.1.0, have provided a safeLoad method for parsing YAML. Developers that use this module should make sure they have upgraded and should strongly consider porting their code to use the new safeLoad method.\n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/16)_\n\n### Details\nThe module allowed code execution due to a custom data-type that it defined and parsed called !!js/function. The way it would parse the data was to create a new Function object in JavaScript based on the input, which is equivalent to calling eval on the input:\n\n```\nfunction resolveJavascriptFunction(object /*, explicit*/) {\n  /*jslint evil:true*/\n  var func;\n\n  try {\n    func = new Function('return ' + object);\n    return func();\n  } catch (error) {\n    return NIL;\n  }\n}\n```\nThat meant the code snippet below, when run, would execute code instead of simply defining a function:\n\n```\nvar yaml = require('js-yaml');\n\nx = \"test: !!js/function > \\n  \\\nfunction f() { \\n    \\\nconsole.log(1); \\n  \\\n}();\"\n\nyaml.load(x);\n```\n\n## Remediation\nDevelopers using the JS-YAML module should make sure that they are working with an up-to-date version and should strongly consider porting their code to use safeLoad in place of load, especially when accepting YAML derived from user input.\n\n## References\n\n- [Code Execution via YAML in JS-YAML Node.js Module](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/06/code-execution-via-yaml-in-js-yaml-nodejs-module/)\n",

The attacker could do anything the compromised users could do, including publishing new versions of packages.\n\n## Details\nThe primary npm registry has, since late 2014, used HTTP bearer tokens to authenticate requests from the npm command-line interface. Due to a design flaw in the CLI, these bearer tokens were sent with every request made by logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request. (The bearers only should have been included for requests made against a registry or registries used for the current install.)\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker to set up an HTTP server that could collect authentication information. They could then use this information to impersonate the users whose tokens they collected. This impersonation would allow them to do anything the compromised users could do, including publishing new versions of packages.\n\nWith the fixes npm have released, the CLI will only send bearer tokens with requests made against a registry.\nnpm’s CLI team believe that the fix won’t break any existing registry setups. However, it’s possible the change will be breaking in some cases, due to the large number of registry software suites used.\n\n## Remediation\n1. Upgrade npm to \">= 3.8.3 || >= 2.15.1\"\n2.

				"description": "## Overview\nA potential remote memory exposure vulnerability exists in `request`. If a `request` uses a multipart attachment and the _body type_ option is `number` with value X, then X bytes of uninitialized memory will be sent in the body of the request.\n\nNote that while the impact of this vulnerability is high (memory exposure), exploiting it is likely difficult, as the attacker needs to somehow control the body type of the request. One potential exploit scenario is when a request is composed based on JSON input, including the body type, allowing a malicious JSON to trigger the memory leak.\n\n### Details\nConstructing a `Buffer` class with integer `N` creates a `Buffer`\nof length `N` with non zero-ed out memory.\n**Example:**\n```\nvar x = new Buffer(100); // uninitialized Buffer of length 100\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100'); // initialized Buffer with value of '100'\n```\n\nInitializing a multipart body in such manner will cause uninitialized memory to be sent in the body of the request.\n\n#### Proof of concept\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http')\nvar request = require('request')\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  var data = ''\n  req.setEncoding('utf8')\n  req.on('data', function (chunk) {\n    console.log('data')\n    data += chunk\n  })\n  req.on('end', function () {\n    // this will print uninitialized memory from the client\n    console.log('Client sent:\\n', data)\n  })\n  res.end()\n}).listen(8000)\n\nrequest({\n  method: 'POST',\n  uri: 'http://localhost:8000',\n  multipart: [{ body: 1000 }]\n},\nfunction (err, res, body) {\n  if (err) return console.error('upload failed:', err)\n  console.log('sent')\n})\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `request` to version 2.68.0 or higher.\n\nIf a direct dependency update is not possible, use [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/documentation/#wizard) to patch this vulnerability.\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/request/request/pull/2018\n- https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Lets-fix-Buffer-API.md#previous-materials\n- https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Buffer-knows-everything.md\n",

				"description": "## Overview\nThe semver module uses regular expressions when parsing a version string. For a carefully crafted input, the time it takes to process these regular expressions is not linear to the length of the input. Since the semver module did not enforce a limit on the version string length, an attacker could provide a long string that would take up a large amount of resources, potentially taking a server down. This issue therefore enables a potential Denial of Service attack. This is a slightly differnt variant of a typical Regular Expression Denial of Service ([ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)) vulnerability.\n\n## Remediation\nUpdate to a version 4.3.2 or greater. From the issue description [2]: \"Package version can no longer be more than 256 characters long. This prevents a situation in which parsing the version number can use exponentially more time and memory to parse, leading to a potential denial of service.\"\n\n## References\n\n- [1] https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n- [2] https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.7.5\n",

GeoJSON is a format used for encoding a variety of geographic data structures in a standard JSON document. The vulnerability exists within GeoJSON documents using the function \n`ST_GeomFromGeoJSON` (for postgresql/postgis) and the function `GeomFromText` (for mysql). \n\nNote that `sequelize` users who do not use these specific functions are not affected.

This access_key is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.\n\nThe key is checked by checking to see if the access_key provided in the request is within the configured access_key string, not equal to. So a single character that's within the access key is sufficient to bypass this control.\n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/38)_\n\n## Details\n\n**Example:**\n\nThis is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.\n\n```\nif (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {\n```\n\nFor an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8081/api/exec\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @test -H \"access-key: a\"\n{\n \"cmd\": \"ls\",\n \"path\": \".\",\n \"stdout\": \"app.js\\nconfig.js\\nlog\\nnode_modules\\nserver.js\\n\",\n \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n**Mitigating factors:**\n\nThe admin interface is disabled by default. The module author confirmed that the access_key should really be an array of access_keys, however based on variable name and documentation it was not clear that it should be an array. The vulnerability exists only if a string access_key is set.\n\nModule version 0.0.6 has been updated to ensure an array of keys is provided as well as documentation updates.\n\n## References\n\n",

				"description": "## Overview\nA client side memory disclosure vulnerability exists in ping functionality of the ws service. When a client sends a ping request and provides an integer value as ping data, it will result in leaking an uninitialized memory buffer. \n\n## Details\nThere were no checks performed on the type of data to be sent. With buffers in node when you allocate it with a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.\n\n**Example:**\n```\nvar x = new Buffer(100);\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100');\n```\n\nThis would allocate 100 bytes of memory in the first example and just 3 bytes with 100 as value in the second example. \n\n```\nvar ws = require('ws')\n\nvar server = new ws.Server({ port: 9000 })\nvar client = new ws('ws://localhost:9000')\n\nclient.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('open')\n  client.ping(50) // this makes the client allocate an uninitialized buffer of 50 bytes and send it to the server\n\n  client.on('pong', function (data) {\n    console.log('got pong')\n    console.log(data)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/1.0.1\n- https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/4525\n",

In those speeds, a payload of this size can be transmitted in seconds.\n\n## Remediation\nUpdate to version 1.1.1 or greater, which sets a default `maxPayload` of 100MB.\nIf you cannot upgrade, apply a Snyk patch, or provide `ws` with options setting the `maxPayload` to an appropriate size that is smaller than 256MB.\n\n## References\n- WS Issue: https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/0328a8f49f004f98d2913016214e93b2fc2713bc\n- Resulting crash in Node: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7388\n\n\n",

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7577. \n\nVersions Affected:  3.1.0 and newer \nNot affected:       3.0.x and older \nFixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1 \n\nImpact \n------ \nWhen using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent the \ndestruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy: false` option \nto the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. However due to a change in the \ncommit [a9b4b5d][1] the `_destroy` flag prevents the `:reject_if` proc from \nbeing called because it assumes that the record will be destroyed anyway. \n\nHowever this isn't true if `:allow_destroy` is false so this leads to changes \nthat would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers could use \nthis do things like set attributes to invalid values and to clear all of the \nattributes amongst other things. The severity will be dependent on how the \napplication has used this feature. \n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of \nthe workarounds immediately. \n\nReleases \n-------- \nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations. \n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nIf you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer \nthat is loaded before your application: \n\n``` \n$ cat config/initializers/nested_attributes_bypass_fix.rb \nmodule ActiveRecord \n  module NestedAttributes \n    private \n\n    def reject_new_record?(association_name, attributes) \n      will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes) || call_reject_if(association_name, attributes) \n    end \n\n    def call_reject_if(association_name, attributes) \n      return false if will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes) \n\n      case callback = self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:reject_if] \n      when Symbol \n        method(callback).arity == 0 ? send(callback) : send(callback, attributes) \n      when Proc \n        callback.call(attributes) \n      end \n    end \n\n    def will_be_destroyed?(association_name, attributes) \n      allow_destroy?(association_name) && has_destroy_flag?(attributes) \n    end \n\n    def allow_destroy?(association_name) \n      self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:allow_destroy] \n    end \n  end \nend \n``` \n\nPatches \n------- \nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for \nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a \nsingle changeset. \n\n* 3-2-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 3.2 series \n* 4-1-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 4.1 series \n* 4-2-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 4.2 series \n* 5-0-nested-attributes-reject-if-bypass.patch - Patch for 5.0 series \n\nPlease note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users \nof earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we \ncannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported \nreleases. \n\nCredits \n------- \nThank you to Justin Coyne for reporting the problem and working with us to fix it. \n\n[1]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/a9b4b5da7c216e4464eeb9dbd0a39ea258d64325 \n",

				"description": "There is a vulnerability when Active Record is used in conjunction with JSON\nparameter parsing. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2012-2660,\nCVE-2012-2694 and CVE-2013-0155.\n\nImpact\n------\n\nDue to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way\nthat JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker to issue\nunexpected database queries with \"IS NULL\" or empty where clauses.  This issue\ndoes *not* let an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query, however\nthey can cause the query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when\nmost users wouldn't expect it.\n\nFor example, a system has password reset with token functionality:\n\n```ruby\n    unless params[:token].nil?\n      user = User.find_by_token(params[:token])\n      user.reset_password!\n    end\n```\n\nAn attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will return\n`[nil]`.  The `[nil]` value will bypass the test for nil, but will still add\nan \"IN ('xyz', NULL)\" clause to the SQL query.\n\nSimilarly, an attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will\nreturn an empty hash.  An empty hash will eliminate the WHERE clause of the\nquery, but can bypass the `nil?` check.\n\nNote that this impacts not only dynamic finders (`find_by_*`) but also\nrelations (`User.where(:name => params[:name])`).\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the\nwork arounds immediately. All users running an affected release should upgrade\nimmediately. Please note, this vulnerability is a variant of CVE-2012-2660,\nCVE-2012-2694, and CVE-2013-0155.  Even if you upgraded to address those\nissues, you must take action again.\n\nIf this chance in behavior impacts your application, you can manually decode\nthe original values from the request like so:\n\n    `ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(request.body)`\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nThis problem can be mitigated by casting the parameter to a string before\npassing it to Active Record.  For example:\n\n  ```ruby\n    unless params[:token].nil? || params[:token].to_s.empty?\n      user = User.find_by_token(params[:token].to_s)\n      user.reset_password!\n    end\n  ```\n",

If this resulting JSON string is subsequently \ninserted directly into an HTML page, the page will be vulnerable to XSS attacks. \n\nFor example, the following code snippet is vulnerable to this attack: \n\n    <%= javascript_tag \"var data = #{user_supplied_data.to_json};\" %> \n\nSimilarly, the following is also vulnerable: \n\n    <script> \n      var data = <%= ActiveSupport::JSON.encode(user_supplied_data).html_safe %>; \n    </script> \n\nAll applications that renders JSON-encoded strings that contains user-controlled \ndata in their views should either upgrade to one of the FIXED versions or use \nthe suggested workaround immediately. \n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nTo work around this problem add an initializer with the following code: \n\n  module ActiveSupport \n    module JSON \n      module Encoding \n        private \n        class EscapedString \n          def to_s \n            self \n          end \n        end \n      end \n    end \n  end \n",

Because of 2, the requests were also not authorizing confidential\n   clients' ability to revoke a given token.

Because of the bug described above, this is not the\ncase. As far as OWASP is concerned, this counts as broken authentication\ndesign.\n\nMITRE has assigned CVE-2016-6582 due to the security issues raised.
